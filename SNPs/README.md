## Shared SNPs  

Here we show all traits associated with SNPs shared between married individuals who share slices.

Slices are denoted by CHR_ID (chomosome ID) plus slice_bp1 (basepair position of the start of the slice) and slice_bp2 (basepair position of end of the slice). The common allele is under the "base" column.

All features are extracted from the GWAS catalog, e.g., https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/regions/chr10:122598339-123215850.
